1. Make a different game from the one I made
2. Use more than one file, and use `require` to use them. Make sure you know what that is.
3. Use one _class per room_ and give the classes names that fit their purpose (like `GoldRoom`, `KoiPondRoom`).
4. Your runner will need to know about these rooms, so make a class that runs them and knows about them. There's plenty of ways to do this, but consider having each room return which room is next or setting a variable of which room is next.
