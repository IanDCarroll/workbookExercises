This is a record of my journey through workbooks.

The Puropse of these exercises is to practice the basics and reduce knowlege gaps in my understanding. This serves to buld ood fundimentals of programming in context. It also serves as a fantastic introduction to Python, Ruby and C.

Right now I'm going through Zed Shaw's books because their approach is exactly what I like. Learn by doing, discovering theory in the context of practice. It is also quite an agile approach, and decently craftsmanly. 

Once I'm done those, I'll start putting more stuff over here as well, as I rediscover JavaScript, work on Java, Rust, C++ or whatever else I feel like.

If anyone has tips, please open up an issue and let me know. I'd very much appreciate the insight from another point of view! :smile:
