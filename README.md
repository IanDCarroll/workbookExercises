This is a record of my journey through workbooks.

The Puropse of these exercises is to shore up the basics and reduce knowlege gaps in my understanding. 

A lot of these problems I already understand. The ones I do not are the ones that have the obvious knowlege gaps in them. Moments of learning or reinforcement of basics will be included in comments to get me in the habit of good documentation.

As for scrum, Scrum is not anti-documentation. It just puts working code first.
Good doccumentation serves working code.
Wasteful doccumentation leads working code.

Less time needs to be spent preparing to do. More time should be spent doing. Preparation should be kept to only what's needed to get started. Othewise there's a risk of yakshaving. 

I've been working on this workbook before I decided to post it. The first 16-or-so problems from Learn Python the Hard Way will have very little comments. The ones following should have doccumentation serving to show how I'm thinking about the code.

If anyone has tips or insights that I have missed in the comments, please open up an issue and leat me know. I'd very much appreciate the insight from another point of view! :grinning:
