What I've encountered so fat in Learn Python the Hard Way:
A Pokedex :)

`print "text."`
`print "Text.", variable, "More text"`
`print "%s Text." % variable`
`print "%r Text: %d" % (raw_variable, int_variable)`
`print "Text and " + "more text."`
`print "Text and %s." %"more text"`
`print "This will not have a \n",`
`print "Spam!" * 16`
print displays text to the right of it that is in parentheses on the coomand line.
It can use variables as well embedded in the text in two ways.
    One is to use comas and stick the variable wherever it goes. Print will stringify and concatenate.
    The other is to use % after the text followed by the variable, or variables in parantheses.
	%s is for strings
	%r is for raw data however it comes. good for debugging.
	%d is for integers
	%f is for floating points
print automatically puts a `\n` newline character at the end so that the next line doesn't run on from the print statement.
You can opt out of that by using a comma at the end of the statement.
If you include a multiply operator, print will repeat the text that many times.

`"text."`
An example of a string, which is a basic data type made up of an immutable sequence of characters, whitespace and numbers.

`#`
Hash is a comment. Everthing on the same line to the right of it is ignored by the program, but can be read by another developer to know what's up with the code. It is the code that is for the human component of the program, but likely not for the user.

`25`
An example of an integer. Integer is a data type in pyhton along with strings, booleans, and floating point numbers.

`+`
Adds numbers together, or if a string, concatenates.

`-`
Subtracts numbers
if no number on the left, makes the number on the right a negative number.

`*`
Multiplies numbers

`/`
Divides numbers

`%`
When used as an operator for numbers, modulates them (returns the remainder of a division)

`<`
Less-than operator. compares numbers to right and left. Returns True if the relationship is true, else False.

`>`
Greater-than operator, see above ^

`>=`
Greater-than-or-equal-to operator, see above ^

`<=`
Less-than-or-equal-to-operator, see above ^

`==`
equal-to operator, see above ^

`_`
used in names to make it more human-readable

`4.0`
Floating point number, called a float. nay number with a decimal point is one of these. Python allows for indefinately precise floating point numbers. The limit to precision is the hardware's RAM. If you try to mix data types, add an int to a float, python returns a float.

`name = 'Zed A. Shaw'`
This is a variable. It is characterized by a name, which can be any A-z, _, and 0-9 characters in a row that is not started by a number. the = sign here assigns the variable a value. In this case the `name` variable is assigned a string as it's value.

`round(number[, ndigits])`
This is a builtin function in python. round rounds the number to the nearest specified decimal. If none is selected, the decimal is set to zero. But it's a little tricky in certain situations. for more info: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#round

`False`
This is an example of a boolean data type, a true or false value. The only other boolean is `True`. It can also be represented as 0 and 1. `0 == False` and `1 == True`.

`\n`
Newline character. This is a two-character representation in code of a signle special character in white space. It is the character that is invisibly typed whenever you hit ENTER in a word processor. It has friends, but it should be noted independently because it's something to watch out for.

```
"""
block
of
text
"""
```
Three quotes are useful in print statements when you have to type out multiple lines or a small novel.
If you use `'''` It will give you the raw version of the text, so any \n or other escape characters will be printed as-is.
useful for debugging. Make sure to escape out any of the same quotes in the text.
