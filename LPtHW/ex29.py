# If statements condidionally execute the code 
# that is indented under them in python. 

# If statements are found in every programming language.
# When the boolean expression following them is True, 
# they run the code block beneath them.

# when the boolean expression returns False, 
# they skip the code block beneath them.

# This is a basic control structure that allows for all kinds 
# of decision trees and conditional circumstances in the code. 
# It is very very very useful.
