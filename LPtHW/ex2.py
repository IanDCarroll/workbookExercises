# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."

# ******************************

# I avoided this excercise because I thought it was too boring 
# and I didn't need it.
# I was in a hurry to learn and thought I could skip this exercise.
# In fact, I skipped quite a few exercises after this one, too.

# Now, I'm going back through and making sure 
# I didn't miss anything important.

# It's an exercise in patience, presence, focus, and attention to detail.
